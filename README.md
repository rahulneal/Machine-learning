Gender Prediction 

Introduction

Age and gender, two of the key facial attributes, play a very foundational role in social interactions, making age and gender
estimation from a single face image an important task in intelligent applications, such as access control, human-computer 
interaction, law enforcement, marketing intelligence and visual surveillance, etc.
Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Python3.6

opencv

A caffe model has 2 associated files,
1 .prototxt — The definition of CNN goes in here. This file defines the layers in the neural network, each layer’s inputs, outputs and functionality.
2 .caffemodel — This contains the information of the trained neural network (trained model).

Download .prtotxt and .caffemodel from Here.
